    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Professional -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, thematic application is chosen for intuitive, non-linear exploration. The structure includes a hero section, a foundational 'Core Philosophy' section, and the main interactive 'Three Pillars' section navigated by tabs. Each pillar contains interactive, clickable cards for specific skills that expand to show details. A dynamic Chart.js chart is included to visually quantify the impact of these skills on BPO metrics. This structure transforms a linear slideshow into an engaging, self-paced learning tool, allowing users to explore content at their own pace while reinforcing the value of the skills through data visualization. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Content is organized into thematic sections. Key skills are presented as interactive cards (HTML/CSS/JS) that expand on click to reveal details (Goal: Inform/Engage). This avoids information overload and encourages active user participation. A grouped bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is used to compare key BPO metrics with and without strong soft skills (Goal: Compare/Inform), making the business impact tangible and justifying the importance of the training. This choice adds a data-driven element that strengthens the qualitative content. Unicode characters are used for simple iconography. A new "Positive Language Transformer" feature is added using the Gemini API (LLM Text Generation) to allow users to practice rephrasing negative statements into positive ones, directly supporting the "Clear Communication" skill. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
